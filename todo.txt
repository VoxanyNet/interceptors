different enemy deaths
    head falls off if headshot
    dissolve if lots of damage
    normal ragdoll by default

lobby (with lobby music)
    lobby maybe be in space like a spaceship

physics particle when you hit a prop 

SOUNDS

figure how to go to other areas

buy guns from government

buy structures from the goverment

if too many enemies get through you get fired

possibly have a gun shoot update so that props crumble more convincingly

velocity updates for each pixel thing 

larger dissolved pixels
    have props with more pixels have lower pixel density

when you start the game you are instantly connected to the lobby with the title being rendered which fades away as you move
